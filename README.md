# PRODIGY_GA_01

Steps of the project:

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to undertake a project like training a GPT-2 model using the aitextgen library:
### Step 1: **Project Planning**- Clearly define the project goal: Training a GPT-2 model to generate text based on a specific dataset.
- Outline the project scope, including the data you will use, the model architecture, and the training steps.
### Step 2: **Setting Up the Environment**- Ensure your development environment supports GPU acceleration for faster training.
- Install necessary libraries: aitextgen, pytorch, transformers, and pytorch_lightning.  
  pip install aitextgen torch transformers pytorch_lightning  
### Step 3: Data Preparation
- Prepare your dataset in a text file (`input.txt`). Ensure it is cleaned and formatted to suit the model's requirements.- If needed, preprocess the data to improve training performance (e.g., removing stopwords, tokenization).
### Step 4: Model Initialization
- Import the aitextgen library and initialize the GPT-2 model. - Load the pre-trained model with a specific configuration (`124M` in this case) and move it to GPU for faster processing.
  
  ai = aitextgen(tf_gpt2="124M", to_gpu=True)  
### Step 5: Model Training
- Start training the model using the prepared dataset.- Define the training parameters: number of steps, batch size, learning rate, etc.
- Ensure the model is saved at regular intervals during training to avoid data loss.  
  ai.train("input.txt",           line_by_line=True,
           from_cache=False,           num_steps=2000,
           generate_every=100,           save_every=500,
           save_gdrive=False,           learning_rate=1e-3,
           fp16=False,           batch_size=1)
  
### Step 6: **Model Evaluation**- After training, evaluate the model by generating text samples based on specific prompts.
- Adjust the prompt to explore different text generation scenarios.  
  ai.generate(10, prompt="What a wonderful day")  
### Step 7: Fine-Tuning and Optimization
- Review the generated outputs and fine-tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters or using a more refined dataset.- Consider increasing the training steps or using a larger model if needed.

### Step 8: **Documentation and Sharing**- Document the entire process, including the code, steps, and any challenges faced.
- Share your findings and results on platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, or a personal blog.
### Step 9: **Reflection and Next Steps**- Reflect on the project's outcome, what was learned, and how it can be improved in the future.
- Plan future projects or extensions, such as deploying the model or integrating it with an application.
